Welcome to Class!

.. NOTE:: You should have received all your student info to access the lab; if you have not, please find an instructor.

Agenda
------

This class is focused on the F5 Automation Toolchain. It has been created to introduce students to the components and their uses. You should have a basic understanding of BIG-IP technologies and a desire to learn about automation and orchestration.

Composable infrastructure provides the mechanism to create reusable items. With small reusable items, we can create more frequent changes gaining better agility and controlled fault domains.

All students will experience the same presentations and end solutions in the lab. However, there are two different paths the students can choose to take.

- F5 Declarative Onboarding (Presentation)
- F5 Application Services 3 (Presentation)
- F5 Telemetry Streaming (Presentation)

- Priming the Environment
        - Lab Setup (Module 1)

- Postman Deployment - Option 1
        - F5 Declarative Onboarding (Module 2)
        - F5 Application Services 3 (Module 3)
        - F5 Telemetry Streaming (Module 4)

- Ansible Tower Deployment - Option 2
        - Configuring Ansible Tower (Module 5)
        - F5 ATC Installation Playbook (Module 6)
        - F5 Declarative Onboarding Playbook (Module 7)
        - F5 Application Services 3 Playbook (Module 8)
        - F5 Telemetry Streaming Playbook (Module 9)

Expected time to complete: **2 hours**

Resources in this lab are documented and released on F5 CloudDocs_. **It is encouraged after the lab to read through these sections for broader learning.**

F5 provides a formal series of labs focusing on the enablement of engineers looking to interact with BIG-IP products programmatically. The Super-NetOps_ program is free, self-service, and open to anyone.
